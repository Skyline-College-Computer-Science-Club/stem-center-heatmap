# Stem-Center-Heatmap

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>The end product we will get building this project is an insight analysis on student traffic at Skyline College’s STEM Center. We will be building an end-to-end pipeline, starting from data cleaning to visualization.</p>

<h2>How to Run Program</h2>

Make sure you have all the necessary python packages installed on your machine.

Do this by running 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. this will install the packages in the requirements.txt file.

If there are any further error, some troubleshooting to install further packages is needed (requirements.txt may not be updated - TODO).

To run the app to display the heatmap with a simple UI,
1. 'cd' into streamlit/ folder
2. Run 'streamlit run app.py' in terminal
3. Paste given link into web browser

<h2>Why do we need that?</h2>
<p>A huge amount of data flows through Skyline College’s sign-in page on Accademia. Huge amounts of data translates into potential to cater resources to students utilizing Skyline College STEM Center most frequently. </p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<p>In order to accomplish our goal we need a few things:</p>
<b>
<ul>
  <li>Data from Skyline College's STEM Center</li>
  <li>Pandas - Python for data manipulation</li>
  <li>A way to provide those analytics to a end-user</li>
</ul>
